# Benard Karanja

**Full-Stack Software Engineer | Cybersecurity & Offensive Security**

I specialize in building secure, scalable, and production-ready systems with embedded security controls informed by offensive security and adversarial testing experience. I design systems assuming they will be attacked and ensure they remain resilient, observable, and maintainable under real-world conditions.
