# Benard Karanja

**Full-Stack Software Engineer | Cybersecurity & Offensive Security**
I am a software engineer specializing in building secure, scalable, and production-ready systems. My work focuses on full-stack web development with embedded security controls, informed by hands-on offensive security and adversarial testing experience.
I design systems with the assumption that they will be attacked and ensure they remain resilient, observable, and maintainable under real-world conditions.
